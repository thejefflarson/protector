//! Per-finding recency / Δ data (JEF-201): the small, pure types the verdict store tracks
//! per entry to answer "what changed since I last looked?" — the [`StoredPosture`] the
//! engine diffs pass-to-pass, the resulting [`Delta`] glyph verdict, and the [`RecencyInfo`]
//! the view maps into the dense table's Δ column.
//!
//! These are DATA-layer types (they live beside [`super::model`] and carry no markup). The
//! recency they encode is derived from the store's first-seen / previous-posture history,
//! NOT from render time, so it survives the `/fragment` 30s poll (a re-render with no new
//! pass keeps the stored [`Delta`]) and a journal-restore on boot (a restored entry reads
//! [`Delta::Restored`], never [`Delta::New`]). Pure presentation metadata: it gates nothing,
//! feeds no model, and the engine stays SHADOW (ADR-0016: recency is a view).
